# ArStore

#### A framework allowing organizations to adopt ArWeave incrementally for object storage. 

---

Let's take, for example, a Culturally Important Magazine. Currently, their editors use A Boring CMS to manage content and they persist their data on a cloud-based network. Increasingly, whispers have been spreading amongst literary circles about government activity around censorship. One of the younger guys on staff brings something called ArWeave to the attention of the CTO, who’s immediately excited by the notion of data permanence.  

She looks into it a bit. ArWeave is without question exciting but the ecosystem is still small. She notices the apps are promising but incontrovertibly less mature than even the most forgettable of cloud-based storage solutions. She only faintly knows how a blockchain works and fears the risks inherent to embracing a new technology. She can’t help but feel wary of the cognitive barriers w/ re: to the mechanics/implementation. She knows right away they’re not ready to bring their whole operation over to the permaweb and wishes there were a simple, configurable WordPress plugin instead. At the point of content-submission, she would love it if editors could tick a box to upload sensitive works to the permaweb for safe keeping.

The approach I propose here is to build:

1. A UI to manage things like sign-ups and account settings. It would allow users to create their organization, generate schemas to describe the various shapes of their data (more of a stretch goal — the schemas could be used to validate data before committing it), as well as to view the current state of their data. The UI would be comparable to a headless CMS.

2. An API to handle the legwork. It would offer a dumbed-down interface vs. the current Arweave HTTP API in the hopes of encapsulating away as much as possible of the complexity necessary to interface with the chain, leveraging the account settings originally configured via the UI to prime the dev-facing convenience functions. It could be further abstracted into plugins, etc.

Quickly, roughly:

ArWeave as well as blockchain-based tech in general are still very new to me, so, questions:

1. This concept is pretty basic/foundational; has it already been spoken for by someone else?
2. Ordinarily, I would serve my own API. ArWeave, however, doesn't support hosting your own server. ArWeave's HTTP API makes that tenable, though, right? Ie. to create a library that would serve as the "API", as sketched above, is it as simple as making wrappers around the official ArWeave SDKs?

I think it would be particularly neat and important to bring this ease of use to those who would otherwise take a pass on ArWeave. There are obviously some UX challenges around how to manage payment and all of that. But I  believe the concept to be sound enough to make it worth those hurdles.
